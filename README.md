# LIS Vision Flight
Open source, simple fixed-wing drone for vision-based flight experiments

The LIS Vision flight project aims to give easy access to a vision-based fixed-wing drone to conduct experiments. It features
- a global shutter camera for vision-based applications
- an oboard single board computer to process vision data and for control
- a flow sensor and a point lidar for vision-based pose estimation
- a high precision RTK GNSS to provide ground truth data
- airspeed sensor for estimates of wind speeds
- a telemetry radio for communication with a ground station
- a PX4 autopilot that handles
  - sensor reading
  - actuator commanding
  - state estimation
  - time-synced camera triggering
  - attitude control
  - communication for RTK corrections
